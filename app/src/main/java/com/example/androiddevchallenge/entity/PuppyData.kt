However based on the varying colours of the pups, there may be more than one breed involved.\n\nSamuel loves to smile at his friends!\n\nWhile we have no clarification, we believe that a couple of the pups may have hearing issues.\nSamuel is currently housed with his 13 brothers and sisters and they love to play and get along very well. He loves his human companions and meeting new friends.\n\nLike every pup, Samuel will thrive with early socialisation and exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences will ensure he grows to be a well rounded guy.\n\nHe still has so much to learn about the world and life and would love to be in a home where he is included as a member of the family. Samuel will thrive in an environment that guides him with positive direction and lots of love and attention.\nPlease note that if you have an existing dog in residence, we will require a meet and greet to ensure they get along and will be always best buddies. When organising a meet and greet, we will require a current vaccination certificate for your existing dog to ensure that there is no chance of infecting the pups who are currently not up to date with their vaccinations.",

    description = "Hi. My name is Zander and I am a playful, clever and happy pup.\n\nI arrived in the Rescue at two weeks old, so have been hand raised by carers. Having humans caring for me from such a young age, I like to have people around me. I do love children too, but would be best suited to older children as I can forget that people don't like bitey games very much and I can be a bit nibbly when I get excited.\n\nI am well socialised and live with dogs of all ages and sizes. I enjoy playing with my four-legged foster siblings, especially chasing games and tug-of-war. Oh, and dragging big palm leaves around the yard makes me feel big and strong, so I show off to my foster siblings constantly with that trick. They aren't as strong as me, so they think I am very clever.\n\nSpeaking about clever, I am quite a smart pup and can sit beautifully. Actually, my bottom hits the ground as soon as I see the signal to sit when there are treats involved. I am also learning to sit for pats, so that when I am a grown up dog, I will know not to jump on people. I would benefit from a new family who would keep up my training, so I can grow into a polite and well-mannered adult.\n\nI am a legend at house training too. I haven't wet in my puppy pen at night since I was three weeks old, and I run outside when I need a toilet break. I rarely have accidents indoors... aren't I the best?!?!\n\nSo... if you are looking for a staffy with character, personality and pizzazz, look no further. Here I am.\n\nSee you soon!\n\nLove, Zander",

    description = "My name is Lola and I’m a show girl, my special talent is I show my joy and happiness all over my body when I wag my tail! I have lots of reasons to be happy since me and my brothers were rescued. I may be a little shy when I meet you, but I quickly warm up to you and show you my belly for scratches.\n\nMy foster mum says I’m the calmest most gentle puppy she has ever had the pleasure of fostering! I think I’m going to get big (40-50kg) , I’m already big enough to smell things out on counters. But my foster mum says I’m smart, and my manners are pretty good. I’m sure with the right instruction from my forever parents I can continue to keep these manners.\n\nMy perfect home would have at least one other dog for me to play with if my parents have to go to work. My foster home has two cats and a 6 year old dog. I’m really polite to all of them (as I said, I have lovely manners) I also have a foster human brother who is 9, and I absolutely adore him. I haven’t mouthed him or anything, and I love to snuggle with him on his lap. Just to be on the safe side, good high fencing might help keep me safe.\n\nI love to play and love to have lots of different toys for enrichment (aka I like to bite them and pull them apart if I can) but hey, when you don’t have hands to explore you have to use your mouth and teeth. I’ve only been with my foster family a short time, and have already mastered the trick of fetching and returning a tennis ball! I also enjoy chasing after big balls along the ground. But I’m still a puppy, and need lots of time for rests in between zoomies. I’m sure once I’ve had all of my vaccinations I will enjoy going for walks with you too!\n\nAt night I’ve been sleeping in my foster parents room, and so far, no accidents. I’m really good at going outside to do my business. I also sleep really well during the night, and don’t wake them up!\n\nIf you have room for a girl who is going to love you to bits and continue to grow and learn, I’m the one for you!",

I love dogs of all shapes and sizes and adore playing with my four-legged foster friends. I enjoy being with children and am learning very quickly that nibbling fingers is a no-no. I would love to have a doggy friend or two in my forever home and children as well would be just wonderful!\n\nHouse training is rather under control too. I may still have little legs, but I do my very best to get outside to the grass in time. Of course, I still have the rare accident indoors but my little legs will grow more soon!\n\nI am a quiet boy. I don't bark or cry and I am a very good sleeper at night time. My bedtime crate is one of my favourite places. I sleep all night without even a peep. Of course, I am probably more content because my crate is in my carer's bedroom and I know she is always close by me.\n\nI am an indoor/outdoor dog. Currently, I can go inside or outside as I please all day through the doggy door. Because I am so trusted in my foster home, I am careful to be very well mannered.\n\nI am learning to sit for my pats so I won't jump on my family when I am all grown up. Plus I have good recall and I come when I am called.\n\nHave you been looking for a loving and clever pup just like me? Well, your search is over! Here I am just waiting to meet you!\n\nLove, Robbie",

I like to play with dogs of all sizes and am very tolerant of the more cheeky pups in my foster home. I would really love a playmate in my new home, who could be my best friend. Currently, I have my litter brother in care with me and we play constantly and snuggle up together every nap time. Do you think your dog would play with me and cuddle up with me too?\n\nI adore people hugs! My foster Mum tells me that I melt into her shoulder when she cuddles me. I can be a little excitable and become nibbly sometimes when I play though, so I may not be suitable for very young children.\n\nI am a fast learner. So far I have learnt how to sit, especially when there is a treat or pat involved, and I am doing fabulously with my toilet training.\n\nIn my foster home, I am never locked outside and have access to indoors and outdoors all day because I am so well behaved. I even sleep in a crate in my foster Mum's bedroom. I am the best sleeper too and always sleep through the night.\n\nSo... do I sound like the new family member you are looking for? A pup who is well behaved, friendly and loving?\n\nI can't wait to meet you.\n\nSee you soon!\n\nLove, Jimmy",
